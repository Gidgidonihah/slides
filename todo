# TODO
Things needed for this repo

## General
* Migrate slides to 4.5.0
* Remove current shared content
* Move /moon-override.css to /shared/css/moon-override.css
* Adjust the nginx config to allow display rather than download of markdown files
* Use some sort of templating so I don't have to replicate html. Generate it.

## Additional slides to make
* Vim
